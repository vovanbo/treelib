Taxonomy tree implementation.

`Tree data structure
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28data_structure%29>`_ is an
important data structure in computer programming languages. It has
wide applications with hierarchical data connections say file systems
and some algorithms in Machine Learning. `ttree
<https://github.com/vovanbo/ttree>`_ is created to provide an
efficient implementation of tree data structure in Python.

The main features of ``ttree`` includes:

* Efficient operation of node indexing with the benefit of dictionary type.
* Support common tree operations like **traversing**, **insertion**,
  **deletion**, **node moving**, **shallow/deep copying**,
  **subtree cutting** etc.
* Support user-defined data payload to accelerate your model construction.
* Has pretty tree showing and text/json dump for pretty print and offline
  analysis.

Quick Start
-----------

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install ttree
