Install
==========

The rapidest way to install `ttree` is using the package management tools like
``pip`` with command:

	.. code-block:: sh

		$ pip install ttree


**Note**: With the package management tools, the hosted version may be falling
behind current development branch on `Github
<https://github.com/vovanbo/ttree>`_. If you encounter some problems, try
the freshest version on Github or open `issues
<https://github.com/vovanbo/ttree/issues>`_ to let me know your problem.
